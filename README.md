# Web 3 problems:

The Web 3 ecosystem is not user-friendly. One major issue for any new users is the uncertainty between signing a transaction and it being successful. It can take about 5-10 mins depending on the network, which can be frustrating for users.

# Our solution:

Instead of building a dapp and solving the UX for that particular dapp, **we created chrome extensions that allows you to track the progress of ongoing transactions on the mantle network and view your recent transactions without having to leave your tab.** It's as easy to use as possible—we designed it with usability in mind.

# Product:

**Echore allows users to track all their transactions- ongoing and successful ones.**

1. For Ongoing transactions:
    1. If you've made an ongoing transaction and it hasn't been confirmed yet, you can see how many blocks have been added to your transaction block since you included it in your order. Once enough blocks are added on top of your transaction block, the transaction is considered successful. This visibility of the transaction makes it easier for new users to trust the system.
2. For completed transaction:
    1. It enables users to view details of completed transactions easily. (removing the need to go and search for transactions in blockchain explorer)

# Product features:

1. No login→ Reduce onboarding friction for new users
2. Clear UI for homepage with all important information shown → allows users to see all of their transactions with no need for them to navigate through any additional pages.
3. Transactions shown with their current USD exchange rate → makes it easier for users to understand the value of their transaction.
4. The On-Going Transactions section is refreshed automatically so that any ongoing transactions will show up automatically in the section. → The network seems responsive to users' actions.
5. The progress bar to show blocks minted on the transaction block. Once the number blocked minted reach critical threshold, the transaction is considered successful. → Reduces the uncertainty between singing on transaction and it being successful.
